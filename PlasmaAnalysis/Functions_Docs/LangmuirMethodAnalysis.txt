Doc String:
    Purpose: To calculator plasma potential and electron current
      saturation using extrapolation with user inputs
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      V: Voltage data
      I: Corresponding current data

	  Vfloat: Floating potential for plotting purposes
	  
    Return:
      Te: Electron Temperature
      Vpl: Plasma potential
      Ie_sat: Electron saturation current
      Ne: Electron density
      Te_err: Max absolute error in electron temperature
      Vpl_err: Max absolute error in plasma potential
      Ie_sat_err: Max absolute error in electron saturation current
      Ne_err: Max absolute error in electron density

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		flagContinue: a boolean value from the GUIs to close GUI and use inputted values 
		e: elementary charge
		me: mass of electron (in kg)
		Area: area of probe (in cm^2)
		Min_Vpe: value from GUI - left edge of pre-electron saturation region
		Max_Vpe: value from GUI - right edge of pre-electron saturation region
		min_Ve: value from GUI - left edge of electron saturation region
		Max_Ve: value from GUI - right edge of electron saturation region
		UI_off: a boolean value from the GUIs to do analysis with previously inputted values
		
	Local:
		LeftIx: index for left edge of voltage to cut off for plotting
	
		xVal: edges of x-axis after plotting log of current - for use after linear fits for Vpe and Ve are plotted 
		yVal: edges of y-axis after plotting log of current - for use after linear fits for Vpe and Ve are plotted
		
		VoltageIn: structure for GUI used in analysis
		UserIn: guihandles of the GUI - for use getting values from GUI
		
		legendtxt: text cell for legend of plot
		
		Vpe_Ids: indices of voltage data that are in the pre-electron saturation region
		Vpe: voltage data that are in the pre-electron saturation region
		Ipe: current data that are in the pre-electron saturation region
		Ppe: linear fit for log of Ipe vs Vpe
		
		Ve_Ids: indices of voltage data that are in the electron saturation region
		Ve: voltage data that are in the electron saturation region
		Ie: current data that are in the electron saturation region
		Pe: linear fit for log of Ie vs Ve
		
		Ne_Pre: constant for calculating electron density
		
Structure/Logic:
	- subtracts fitted ion current from current data if it's provided
	- plots log of current vs voltage for user to determine where pre-electron saturation and electron saturation regions are
	- brings up the GUI for user to input Min_Vpe, Max_Vpe, Min_Ve, and Max_Ve
	- plots Ppe and Pe for user to examine the quality of the fits
	- once user is satisfied with fits (and clicks continue) return values are calculated
	- error values are calculated using LangmuirMethodError()
