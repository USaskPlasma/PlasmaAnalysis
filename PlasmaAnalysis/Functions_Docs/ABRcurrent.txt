ABRcurrent

Usage:
	Ii = ABRcurrent(Vi, N)

Used In:
	Main()
	
Functions Used:
	None
	
Doc String:
    Purpose: return the ABR current for given voltage and plasma density
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      Vi: Measured probe potential corrected for plasma potential
      N: Plasma density
    
    Return:
      Ii: the ion current for Vi according to the ABR model

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		Radius: probe radius (in cm)
		IonAMU: mass of ions in atomic mass units
		Length: probe length (in cm)
		Te_ABR: electron temperature used from fitting the ABR model to the ion current
			that is used in ABRcurrent()
			
	Local:
		Te: electron temperature
		eta: ion voltage divided by electron temperature
		
		I_c: constant for model
		Xi_c: constant for model
			
Structure/Logic:
	- voltage data is divided by Te
	- constants are calculated
	- ABR-model ion current is calculated and returned
