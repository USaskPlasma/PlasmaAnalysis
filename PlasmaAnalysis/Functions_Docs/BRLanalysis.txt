Doc String:
    Purpose: Use BRL theory to calculate plasma density by fitting a
      function of probe potential to the ion current by varrying density
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      V: Voltage data
      I: Current data
      Vfloat: Plasma's floating potential
      Vpl: Plasma potential
      Te: Electron temperature
      Ne: Electron density (for estimating plasma density)
    
    Return:
      N: The plasma density
      N_err: The numerical error in N associated with fitting BRL current
          to the measured ion current
      Te: Fitted electron temperature
      Te_err: Error in electron temperature 
      Rsq: the Rsquared value for the model's fit

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global Variable:
		IonAMU: mass of ions in atomic mass units
		Area: probe surface area (in cm^2)
		Radius: probe radius (in cm)
		Confidence: confidence interval for error values to return
		Te_BRL: electron temperature used from fitting the BRL model to the ion current
			that is used in BRLcurrent()
		
	Local:
		first_id: index for the left-most point of voltage domain for model fitting
		float_id: index for the right-most point of voltage domain for model fitting
		Vi: ion voltage with respect to plasma potential
		Ii: ion current in mA
		
		BRL_coeff: constant for model
		Xi_c: constant for model
		
		modelFun: BRL model for variable ion density and electron temperature
		BRLModel: modelFun fit to the ion current 
		BRL_coeffs: coefficients from fit model (Ion density and electron temperature)
		
		modelFunN: BRL model for variable ion density (and not electron temperature)
		BRLModelN: modelFunN for to the ion current								

Structure/Logic:
	- the voltage and current data is selected for the fitting process.
	- some constants for the model are calculated
	- an attempt is made to fit the model to the ion current with varying ion density and electron temperature
	- electron density and electron temperature from electron characteristics are used for initial values
	- if it is found that the electron temperature is too different from that found using electron characteristics
		then the model is fit again with only the ion density to be fitted and electron temperature will be returned as NaN
	- if the ion density is find to be 5 times more or 5 times less than the ion density then all values of NaN are returned (indicated the fit failed)
	- once an acceptable model has been fit the returned values are calculated from the fit
