Doc String:
    Purpose: To compute important plasma parameters using analog
      derivatives of the current vs. voltage data
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      V: Voltage data
      I: Current with respect to voltage
      d2IdV2: Second derivative of current w/ respect to voltage
      Ii: Provided ion current from best fit model
    
    Return:
      Te: Electron temperature
      Vpl: Plasma Potential
      Ie_sat: Electron saturation current
      Ne: Electron density
      V_EEDF: Voltage for electron energy distribution function
      EEDF: Electron energy distribution function

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		e: elementary charge
		me: electron mass (in kg)
		Area: probe area (in cm^2)
		
	Local:
		N: number of input data points
		
		V_interp: voltage interpolated to have even spacing
		I_interp: current interpolated to have even spacing
		d2IdV2_interp: current second derivative interpolated to have even spacing
		
		Ii_interp: ion current interpolated to have even spacing (if provided, i.e. not NaN)
		
		maxId: index at the maximum value for d2IdV2_interp to be used as a reference point between floating potential and plasma potential
		domain: the minimum and maximum indices for the domain of the Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF)
		
		d2IdV2_EEDF: d2IdV2_interp that is in the domain of the EEDF
		
Structure/Logic:
	- voltage, current, current's second derivative, and ion current (if provided) are interpolated to have even spacing
	- the maximum value of d2IdV2 is found as a reference for finding the EEDF's domain
	- if calculated ion current is provided then it's second derivative is taken and removed from the second derivative 
	- the domain of the EEDF is found by finding the first zeros to the left and right of maxId. If a zero isn't found to the left then the domain
		goes all the way left to the first value. If no zero is found to the right then the right side of the domain (plasma potential) is at the Nth point
	- the plasma potential is found by getting the voltage at the zero on the right side of maxId
	- the EEDF voltage and the d2IdV2 values for the EEDF are found and the EEDF is calculated
	- the final values to be returned are then calculated
