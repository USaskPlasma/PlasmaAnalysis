Usage:
	X = ErrorCrunch( x )
	
Used In:
	Main()
	getAvgData()
	
Functions Used:
	None

Doc String:
    Purpose: Computes the mean and the error associated with the
      confidence interval
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      x: Array of values and their experimental error to compute the mean 
          and error of. First column is of values from analysis and the
          second is of the corresponding values experimental error

    
    Return:
      X(1): Mean values
      X(2): Error associated with confidence interval

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		Confidence: confidence interval for error values to return
		
	Local:
		N: number of data values (rows) entered
		SEM: standard error in values
		ts: T-Score 

Structure/Logic:
	- mean of values is taken
	- Standard error and T-Score is calculated for error bounds
	- the experimental error is averaged and added onto the error bounds
