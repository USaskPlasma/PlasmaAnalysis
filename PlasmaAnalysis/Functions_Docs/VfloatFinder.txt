VfloatFinder

Usage:
	Vfloat = VfloatFinder(V,I);
	
Used In:
	Main()

Functions Used:
	None.
	
Doc String:
	Purpose: Finds the floating potential (first root) of the voltage/
      current data by finding the point where I>0 and then interpolating
      linearly to find root.
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      V: Voltage
      I: Current
    
    Return:
      Vfloat: The floating potential of the plasma

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		None
	
	Local:
		fp_id: The first index in which the current data is > 0
		Vfp: 3 voltage data points surrounding fp_id
		Ifp: 3 current data points surrounding fp_id
		Pf: Polynomial coefficients of linear fit for Vfp and Ifp 

Structure/Logic:
	- finds the first index that I is >= 0 and assigns the value to fp_id
	- gets three voltage (Vfp) and current (Ifp) data points around fp_id
	- gets coefficients for linear fit of Vfp and Ifp
	- solves the root of the the linear fit to acquire Vfloat
