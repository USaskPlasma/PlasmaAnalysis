Doc String:
    Purpose: Use OML theory to calculate plasma density by fitting a
      function of probe potential to the ion current by varrying density
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      V: Voltage data
      I: Current data
      Vfloat: Plasma's floating potential 
      Vpl: Plasma potential
      Te: Electron temperature
      Ne: Electron density for initial guess
    
    Return:
      N: The plasma density
      N_err: The numerical error in N associated with fitting OML current
          to the measured ion current
      Rsq: the Rsquared value for the model's fit
	  
Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		Area: probe area (in cm^2)
		Confidence: confidence interval for error values to return
		IonAMU: mass of ions in atomic mass units
		
	Local:
		float_id: index for the right-most point of voltage domain for model fitting
		Vi: ion voltage with respect to plasma potential
		Ii: ion current in mA
		
		OML_coeff: constant for model
		Grad: gradient of model for fitting purposes (gradient is constant w/ respect to ion density)
		
		F: OML-model ion-current minus ion current data (for least-squared solviing)
		nargout: a value used in Matlab's lsqnonlin()
		Gradient: the gradient returned to lsqnonlin()
		
		options: options for the non-linear least-squares fitting function
		N_factor: plasma density times 1e-11
		resnorm: squared norm of the residual
		residual: Value of F at solution

Structure/Logic:
	- the voltage and current data is selected for the fitting process.
	- some constants for the model are calculated
	- the model fitted to the ion current data by varying the ion density
	- output values are calculated and returned
