	savitzkyGolayFilt Savitzky-Golay Filtering.
	savitzkyGolayFilt(X,N,DN,F) filters the signal X using a Savitzky-Golay 
	(polynomial) filter.  The polynomial order, N, must be less than the
	frame size, F, and F must be odd.  DN specifies the differentiation
	order (DN=0 is smoothing). For a DN higher than zero, you'll have to
	scale the output by 1/T^DN to acquire the DNth smoothed derivative of
	input X, where T is the sampling interval. The length of the input X
	must be >= F.  If X is a matrix, the filtering is done on the columns
	of X.

	Note that if the polynomial order N equals F-1, no smoothing
	will occur.

	savitzkyGolayFilt(X,N,DN,F,W) specifies a weighting vector W with
	length F containing real, positive valued weights employed during the
	least-squares minimization. If not specified, or if specified as
	empty, W defaults to an identity matrix.

	savitzkyGolayFilt(X,N,DN,F,[],DIM) or savitzkyGolayFilt(X,N,DN,F,W,DIM)
	operates along the dimension DIM.
