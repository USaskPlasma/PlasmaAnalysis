DataSorter

Usage:
	X = DataSorter(c, ScanNum)
Used In:
	Main()
	
Functions Used:
	None
	
Doc String:
    Purpose: Serperate individual scans into cells for individual
      analysis. Also chops off first and last Data points
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      x: Data column to manipulate
      ScanNum: column corresponding to x which numbers the data set
    
    Return:
      X: The input data sorted into columns and put in cells 
          corresponding to the scan number

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		None
	
	Local:
		ScanId: incremented value for the current data set
		ScanIx1: value corresponding to the first index of the ScanId		
		
		MoreScans: boolean for when to stop
		
		ScanIx2: value corresponding to the last index of the ScanId

Structure/Logic:
	- if ScanNum is NaN then it's assumed that there's only one data set for this analysis
	- the data (x) and ScanNum are searched through in order to find the which indices correspond to each data set
	- the data from the data set is placed in a cell
	- the first and last values of the data are removed
