Doc String:
    Purpose: get average data and errors for V, I, and d2IdV2 if user
      wants these outputs
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      V: all voltage data
      V_err: all voltage experimental error data
      I: all current data
      I_err: all current experimental error data
      d2IdV2: all analog second derivative data
      d2IdV2_err: all analog second derivative experimental error data

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		None
		
	Local:
		N: number of data sets
		
		Vb_s: minimum, maximum, and voltage step of each data sets
		MinV: highest minimum voltage of all data sets
		MaxV: lowest maximum voltage of all data sets
		Step: average voltage step from all data sets
		
		V_Avg: voltage data created from MinV to MaxV with a voltage step of Step
		L: number of values in V_Avg
		
		V_err_Avg: average error values in the voltage
		
		I_Set: current from each data set interpolated to V_Avg
		I_err_Set: current error from each data set interpolated to V_Avg
		
		I_Avg_Data: a conglomeration of I_Avg and I_err_Avg
		
		I_Avg: average values of I_Set
		I_err_Avg: average values of I_err_Set + error associated with confidence interval
		
		d2I_Set: current's analog second derivative from each data set interpolated to V_Avg
		d2I_err_Set: current's analog second derivative error from each data set interpolated to V_Avg
		
		d2I_Avg_Data: a conglomeration of d2I_Avg and d2I_err_Avg
		
		d2I_Avg: average values of d2I_Set
		d2I_err_Avg: average values of d2I_err_Set + error associated with confidence interval			
		
Structure/Logic:
	- minimum, maximum, and step values are found for all voltage data sets
	- new voltage column is created from largest minimum to smallest maximum with a step size that the average of the step values from all voltage data sets
	- the length of this new column of voltage values is taken for later use
	- if voltage error is provided then the average error values are found; otherwise, V_err_Avg is set to a column of NaNs
	- arrays for the current and current error are set to the values from each data set interpolated to V_Avg
	- each average value for current and it's error is found and placed in a single column
	- this column is then broken down into average current and current error columns
	- the same is done to the current's analog second derivative as the current (if it's provided)
	- the voltage, current, and d2IdV2 and the associated errors are arranged into columns and returned
