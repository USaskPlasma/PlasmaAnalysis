CentralDifferenceDerivative

Usage:
	y = CentralDifferenceDerivative(x, Y)
	
Used In:
	AnalogPlasmaAnalysis()
	
Functions Used:
	None
	
Doc String:
    Purpose: Takes the numerical derivative of Y(x) using the central
      difference method (end points are calculated using forward and
      backwards difference method)
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      x: The indepedant variable spaced linearly
      Y: The function of x which is being differentiated
    
    Return:
      y: The numerical derivative dY(x)/dx

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		None
		
	Local:
		N: number of input data points
	
Structure/Logic:
	- computes derivative using central difference method
