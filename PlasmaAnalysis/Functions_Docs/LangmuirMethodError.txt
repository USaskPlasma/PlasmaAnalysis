Doc String:
	Purpose: Calculate the max errors based on the confidence of fit
      for the linear fits for Pi, Ppe, Pe
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      Vpe: Voltage range for pre electron saturation current region
      Ipe: Current for pre electron saturation current
      Ve: Voltage range for electron saturation current region
      Ie: Current for electron saturation current region
      Ne_Pre: most of the calculation for electron density
      Te: Electron Temperature
      Vpl: Plasma potential
      Ie_sat: Electron saturation current
      Ne: Electron density
    
    Return:
      Te_err: Error for electron temperature
      Vpl_err: Error for plasma potential
      Ie_sat_err: Error for electron saturation current
      Ne_err: Error for electron density


Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		Confidence: confidence value for confidence interval of linear fits
		
	Local:
		Ppe: linear fit for log of Ipe vs Vpe
		Pe: linear fit for log of Ie vs Ve
		
		Ppe_coefs: coefficients of fits of Ppe at the boundaries of the confidence interval
		Pe_coefs: coefficients of fits of Pe at the boundaries of the confidence interval
		
		Vpl_err: values for error in voltage potential given every combination of coefficients - later becomes single value for the maximum error
		Ie_sat_err: values for error in electron saturation current given every combination of coefficients - later becomes single value for the maximum error
		Ne_err: values for error in electron density given every combination of coefficients - later becomes single value for the maximum error
		Te_err: values for error in given the two possible slopes of the pre-electron saturation region - later becomes single values for the maximum error

Structure/Logic:
	- gets coefficients at edges of confidence interval for linear fits Ppe and Pe
	- calculates electron temperature error based on the two slopes of the pre-electron saturation region fit (Ppe)
	- pre-allocates other error values
	- calculates all possible error values corresponding to max and min fites for Ppe and Pe
	- takes the maximum error of all values
