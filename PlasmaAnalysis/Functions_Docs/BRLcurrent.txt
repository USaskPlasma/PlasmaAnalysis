BRLcurrent

Usage:
	Ii = BRLcurrent(Vi, N)

Used In:
	Main()
	
Functions Used:
	None
	
Doc String:
    Purpose: return the BRL current for given voltage and plasma density
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      Vi: Measured probe potential corrected for plasma potential
      N: Plasma density
    
    Return:
      Ii: the ion current for Vi according to the BRL model

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		Radius: probe radius (in cm)
		Area: probe area (in cm^2)
		IonAMU: mass of ions in atomic mass units
		Te_BRL: electron temperature used from fitting the BRL model to the ion current
			that is used in BRLcurrent()
			
	Local:
		Te: electron temperature
		eta: ion voltage divided by electron temperature
		
		BRL_coeff: constant for model
		Xi_c: constant for model
			
Structure/Logic:
	- voltage data is divided by Te
	- constants are calculated
	- BRL-model ion current is calculated and returned
