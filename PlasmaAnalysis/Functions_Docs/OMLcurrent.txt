OMLcurrent

Usage:
	Ii = OMLcurrent(Vi, N)

Used In:
	Main()
	
Functions Used:
	None
	
Doc String:
    Purpose: return the OML current for given voltage and plasma density
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      Vi: Measured probe potential corrected for plasma potential
      N: Plasma density
    
    Return:
      Ii: the ion current for Vi according to the OML model

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		Area: probe area (in cm^2)
		IonAMU: mass of ions in atomic mass units
			
	Local:
		None
			
Structure/Logic:
	- negative voltage values are set to 0
	- OML-model ion current is calculated and returned
