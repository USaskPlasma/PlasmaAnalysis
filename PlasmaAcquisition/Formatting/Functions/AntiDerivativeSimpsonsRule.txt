AntiDerivativeSimpsonsRule

Usage:
	Y = AntiDerivativeSimpsonsRule(x,y)

Used In:
	ReadInData()
	
Functions Used:
	None
	
Doc String:
	Purpose: Take the numerical anti-derivative of y (i.e. integral of y
      from [x(1),x] using Simpson's Rule and quadratic interpolation)
    
    Notice: this function won't check if your domain is linearly spaced!
    
    Pre-Conditions:
      x: Independant linearly-spaced variable with an odd number of 
          points (and >1 point)
      y: Dependant variable with values corresponding to x
    
    Return:
      Y: Anti-derivative computed at all points for x

Intermediate Variables (in Order of Appearance):
	Global:
		None
		
	Local:
		N: number of data points

Structure/Logic:
	Computes the anti-derivative of y for all odd points using Simpson's rule and 
		quadratic interpolation for the even values
